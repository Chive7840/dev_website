# Repository Agent Guidelines

To conserve resources and respect the user's directive, **avoid creating or keeping any JavaScript/TypeScript lockfiles.** This applies to `package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and similar files.

## What to avoid

- Do **not** author or include lockfile content as part of your output. If a task asks for a lockfile, respond that lockfiles should be generated by the package manager locally rather than written by hand. This is the primary safeguard against lockfile bloat.
- Do **not** add code solely to prevent local lockfile generation; rely on the user's package manager to handle lockfiles when needed. Purpose: keeps code changes focused on functional tasks, not lockfile controls.

## How to double-check

- Before committing, verify no lockfiles exist by running `ls package-lock.json npm-shrinkwrap.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml 2>/dev/null` (expecting no output).
- If a command accidentally generates a lockfile, remove it immediately and mention the cleanup in your summary.
